This project was created and saved using Tableau Public and the link is posted in this README.dm file.

Using data from the New York Citi Bike Program I created a report dashboard organizing the data of the users of the Citi Bike program. 

Some sample questions could be answered by looking at the created dashboard:

-  How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?


-  By what percentage has total ridership grown?


-  How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?


-  What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?


-  What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

Included in the Dashboard is a static map, and various other styles of graphs in order to explain my findings with data.
